# Clinic-System
## First Preview
### Introduction
For this first delivery, we worked with the help of the [repository](https://github.com/Proyectos-Vinculacion-FMAT/ClinicaWeb) of Clinica Web that belongs to Carlos Roberto Ek Raigoza, which is a project for the psychology faculty. Therefore, our task is to make it a reality since it has solid foundations; however, it does not yet have a backend.
We worked with the requirements that are already in the [repository](https://github.com/Proyectos-Vinculacion-FMAT/ClinicaWeb).

### Objectives
Our objective is to create a CRUD for only the appointment scheduling section.
We will focus on appointment management to help the secretary/administrator optimize their tasks.
