### What makes the system stand out and different?

The system was created with the goal of helping anyone who needs it.

**How does it help?** It allows users to access psychological care in a simple way. Nowadays, it is increasingly easier to obtain this kind of support: you just need to schedule an appointment. That is precisely what our system offers, as it is specially designed to manage psychological appointments.

There are some platforms that provide basic appointment scheduling features; however, our platform stands out by offering a **personalized user experience, not just a simple calendar**. From the moment users register, they will receive friendly guidance within an easy-to-use environment. What users can do includes:

- Schedule appointments.
- Reschedule them.
- View their activity history.
- Organize scheduled sessions in their calendar.
- Communicate with an assistant (Secretary) who will help with any rescheduling needs.

In this way, we don’t just offer an appointment service, but rather a comprehensive tool that makes the process of seeking psychological help accessible, reliable, and tailored to each person’s needs.
