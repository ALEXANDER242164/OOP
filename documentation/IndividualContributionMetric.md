# Individual Contribution Metric

During the meeting we discussed the tasks that we are working on. In this first review we don't target a limit day due to problems of organization.

We use a method based on size.

|Size|Difficulty|
|----|-----------|
|1   |  Normal   |
|3|Medium|
|5|Hard|

In the following charts, you can [see the PDF](https://github.com/ALEXANDER242164/OOP/blob/First-review/documentation/EachTasks.pdf) with the content
